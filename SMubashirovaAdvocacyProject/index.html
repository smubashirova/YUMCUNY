    <h2>Data and Impact!</h2>
    <img src="img/img/picture2.jpg" />
    <h3>Where can this problem have lasting effects?</h3>
    <p>Why?</p>
    <p>Hunger on college campuses directly affects students' academic performance, physical health, and overall
      well-being. Students experiencing food insecurity may struggle to concentrate in class, leading to lower grades
      and diminished educational outcomes. Additionally, inadequate nutrition can weaken students' immune systems and
      contribute to long-term health issues. Addressing hunger on college campuses is essential for fostering a
      supportive and equitable learning environment.</p>

    <h3>Where else can this problem have lasting effects?</h3>
    <p>This problem can have lasting effects on the campus community, especially addressing food accessibility and
      affordability issues.</p>
    <p>Why?</p>
    <p>Food accessibility and affordability impact students' nutrition, health, and well-being. Limited access to
      nutritious food can lead to health issues like malnutrition and obesity. Financial strain from high food costs can
      increase stress and affect mental health and academic performance, making it crucial to address for a supportive
      campus environment.</p>
